# LVM-Snapshot-Based-VM-Backup
backup script  that uses LVM snapshots to back up a VM running under KVM.   Written/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with qcow2 based Ubuntu VMs running on KVM.

Modify variables under the #variables section to suit your deployment. 

Probably a good idea to test the backup you get from this script to make sure it works in your environment.
